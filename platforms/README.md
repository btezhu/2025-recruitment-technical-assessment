# DevSoc Subcommittee Recruitment: Platforms
Your task is to send a direct message to the matrix handle `@chino:oxn.sh` using the Matrix protocol. However, this message must be sent over a self hosted instance such as through the Conduwuit implementation or the slightly more complicated Synapse implementation.

For this to work your server must be federated, but you do not have to worry about specifics such as using your domain name as your handle (a subdomain will do!) or have other 'nice to have' features. Just a message will do!

**You should write about what you tried and your process in the answer box below.**

If you don't manage to get this working we'll still want to hear about what you tried, what worked and what didn't work, etc. Good luck!

I hosted a Conduwuit instance. The first thing I tried was using the debian instructions (since my VPS is Debian). However, I was unable to get it to work. The site instructed me to change a file `/etc/conduwuit/conduwuit.toml` with my server name, and it advised me that this would be sufficient. However it was not sufficient. I used federationtester.matrix.org to test whether or not my instance was federated, and alas it was not. Connection errors, it told me. At this point, I tried using the Docker image, as docker is supposed to be very repoducable. However, it still was not functioning for me. After some time, I discovered that the mechanism that the different instances use to try to federate is by using the `.well-known/matrix/server` path. For the example instance provided in the documentation, it worked, however for mine it did not. This was also supported by the 404 responses in my access.log from what I can assume was the federationtester.matrix.org server. However, this ended up being the problem. All I needed to do was to enable the `[global.well-known]` section in the conduwuit.toml file, with my server address, in order to enable delegation and thus finally have a working instance. I could not be more overjoyed when I was able to log in through Element for the first time. I tried joining some rooms, however that has so far been unsuccessful for me. I was able to message @chino:oxn.sh. It was like 1:00am, though. I read online that it usually takes some time for a home server to federate with all the servers that are a part of a big room, which probably explains the issue. It also aligns with all the random IPs my server is getting requests from with server federation requests. But yeah, I guess my process throughout all of this has been look at the installation guide. The answer was there all along. And, when encountered errors I looked at how the mainstream implementations respond to the same input, and what differs between my instance and their instance. I guess. In the end, it was quite simple to set up, I just shouldn't have been too hasty.
